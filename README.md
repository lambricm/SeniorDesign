## NOTE

This is my half of my senior design project (finished & displayed 2018). I am moving it from my university's enterprise github to public github. I have not included my partner's graphing portion as it would be unprofessional and does not represent my work. I have altered the code (minorly) so that all of the files still work. I have also altered the user manual to do the same.

In the user manual, it talks about viewing the node data - please see my other repository for the JSON viewer.
